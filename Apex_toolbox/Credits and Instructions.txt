This tool were created to assist and simplify workflow for Apex Legends models in Blender since they cannot be simply exported from the game. Here i collect and organize useful tools/addons/operations all in one place. The addon itself is very light for those just want simple functions. 

If you want to have additional effects like auto set HDRI, Badges, Loot items - download Assets ZIP file from here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/14z98OfTWH9Uku2MFssg1bs2qjjVVkOWz/view?usp=sharing
extract the files in your desired location
Inside addon in the "Readme First" Tab specify Assets folder location.
Thats it. Once you specify location of the Assets - all additional options will appear

v.1.1 Changes: 
	   Adding effects: Flatline Reactive skin, Mirage Decoy Particle system, 4k Damage Badge, 20 Bomb Badge
	   Other Items: Auto parenting for Mirage Effect and Flatline reactive skin
	   Code: Figured out the way to pass custom variables from buttons to Operators. With this significantly reduced the numbers of custom operators as well as less lines of codes. One Operator handling multiple items now. Yay.
v1.2 Changes:  
	   Added 
	   HDRI: Encore, Habitat, Kings Canyon, Olympus, Phase Runner, Storm Point, Worlds Edge
	   Effects: Gibraltar Bubble (Friendly and Enemy), Valkyrie Flames

v1.3 Changes:  
	   Added 
	   S/G Blender option for Autotex
	   Bug Fixes: Recolor option were not appending S/G Blender Shader. Fixed now
	   Warning: You need to install v.1.2 before this fix. This is to reduce filesize. If you already using v1.2 - can just install v1.3 and restart Blender. 
v2.0 Changes:
	   Major changes:
	   Rewrite almost entire code to implement these changes:
	   1. Now this addon is very light for those just want simple light functions. Swithed off those effects with big size (HDRI, Badges, Loot items)
	      If you want to have additional effects - download Assets ZIP file from here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/14z98OfTWH9Uku2MFssg1bs2qjjVVkOWz/view?usp=sharing
		  extract the files in your desired location
		  Inside addon in the "Readme First" Tab specify Assets folder location.
		  Thats it. Once you specify location of the Assets - all additional options will appear
	   2. Recolor now work with custom folders materials, can be with sub-folders or without it. Also added the option for Alpha channel
	   To differentiate which update affecting your current addon - it will be called now "Lite" and "Extended"
	   Extended Added:
	   Badge - Predator S3

v2.1 Changes:
	   Note: if you updating from v2.0 - pls re-download updated assets: https://drive.google.com/file/d/14z98OfTWH9Uku2MFssg1bs2qjjVVkOWz/view?usp=sharing
	   Or if you have limited data - download only updated files and manually replace in your asset folder: https://drive.google.com/file/d/17r_R_vVTcQ__XxR9TV9joz1GZW_ca3jU/view?usp=sharing
	   
	   Added to "Lite":
	   Effects: Seer Ultimate (animated)
	   Experimental: Skydive S9 (animated). 

	   Added to "Extended":
	   HDRI: Kings Canyon (New), Kings Canyon (Night), Apex Lobby, Sky (Not sure its from which map)
	   Loot items: Basically all of them, heals, nades, backpacks, etc.
	   Effects: Added animated energy to the Shield batteries and cells.
	   Base files: Added Legends base material files (eye, teeth, hair, etc) so it will auto link when you recolor the models. (Recolor materials not included base files)
	   
	   fixes:
	   Fixed Gibby bubble center icon not displayed.
	   Fixed mSlot reference before assigning error in Re-color and Autotex.
	   Changes:
	   Rewrite the code for recolor - now it supposed to work completely in autopilot mode, recoloring Legends and also weapons. Just select the folder with images or material folder and it will do the job. The code is straight from the oven, so slight chance errors might pop up. Pls feedback if there are any.. For our Titanfall fans - this will also recolor TTF Legends. 
	   
	   Restart Blender after update.

                                                     USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:
                                            ####################################

1. Most of the tools in the Addon are designed and scaled to Apex models actual size. To size up the model to the correct scale you may do the following:
	a) Import Model
	b) Select bones
	c) Scale down to - 0.0254 (Shortcut for Scale is "S")
	Without correct scale some of the effects will look small/big, colors or textures might be offset too. 
2. Mods/effects/addons added inside are free to use/modify or were created by me/community for this Addon

        Auto_tex:
####################################
 
A little tool that will help you to texture Apex Models automatically. A small improvement being done to this addon. Previously if you select the objects and use the addon - it will Append "Apex Shader" and un-select all objects. Well, not anymore. :) 
Currently support Original "Apex Shader" that comes with Autotex and new Option S/G Blender.

        Re-color:
####################################

Tool to re-color (re-texture) the Legend or the Weapon with the new or updated texture available in the game files. This is modified version of Auto_tex. Nodes plugging procedure taken from there.

Howto:
		a) Extract/Download new textures
		b) Specify the path to the texture folder
		c) Select option if you need Alpha channel to be plugged
		d) Select which shader you want to use
		e) Almost all Material do not have textures for eye, teeth, hair, you need to copy them out from the base model and place all that images into folder named "base"
		   the folder structure should be like this 
          -"Your_material_folder" -> base                                --> all base images here
                                  -> wraith_lgnd_v19_liberator_rc01_body --> body images here
                                  -> wraith_lgnd_v19_liberator_rc01_gear --> gear images here
								  
		  If you have Assets folder installed - you may skip this step, base files included. 
		f) press Re-texture
		
		PS: It is also compartible with Titanfall 2 Models (Beta)
