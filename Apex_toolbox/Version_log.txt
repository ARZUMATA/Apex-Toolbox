	   1. Now this addon is very light for those just want simple light functions. Swithed off those effects with big size (HDRI, Badges, Loot items)
	      If you want to have additional effects - download Assets ZIP file from here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/14z98OfTWH9Uku2MFssg1bs2qjjVVkOWz/view?usp=sharing

	   To differentiate which update affecting your current addon - it will be called now "Lite" and "Extended"
	   Extended Added:

	   Note: if you updating from v2.0 - pls re-download updated assets: https://drive.google.com/file/d/14z98OfTWH9Uku2MFssg1bs2qjjVVkOWz/view?usp=sharing
	   Or if you have limited data - download only updated files and manually replace in your asset folder: https://drive.google.com/file/d/17r_R_vVTcQ__XxR9TV9joz1GZW_ca3jU/view?usp=sharing

	   fixes:
	   Fixed Gibby bubble center icon not displayed.
	   Fixed mSlot reference before assigning error in Re-color and Autotex.
	   Changes:
	   Rewrite the code for recolor - now it supposed to work completely in autopilot mode, recoloring Legends and also weapons. Just select the folder with images or material folder and it will do the job. The code is straight from the oven, so slight chance errors might pop up. Pls feedback if there are any.. For our Titanfall fans - this will also recolor TTF Legends.
