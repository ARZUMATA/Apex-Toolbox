                                            ####################################			
                                                      Version History:
                                            ####################################

v.1.0: Initial Release
v.1.1 Changes: 
	   Adding effects: Flatline Reactive skin, Mirage Decoy Particle system, 4k Damage Badge, 20 Bomb Badge
	   Other Items: Auto parenting for Mirage Effect and Flatline reactive skin
	   Code: Figured out the way to pass custom variables from buttons to Operators. With this significantly reduced the numbers of custom operators as well as less lines of codes. One Operator handling multiple items now. Yay.
v1.2 Changes:  
	   Added 
	   HDRI: Encore, Habitat, Kings Canyon, Olympus, Phase Runner, Storm Point, Worlds Edge
	   Effects: Gibraltar Bubble (Friendly and Enemy), Valkyrie Flames

	   Code: Redone some parts to further reduce lines of code 
	   Bug Fixes: After applying new HDRI and saving blend file default world will be deleted (no user set). Set Fake user for all HDRI and default World now.
v1.3 Changes:  
	   Added 
	   S/G Blender option for Autotex
	   Bug Fixes: Recolor option were not appending S/G Blender Shader. Fixed now

v2.0 Changes:
	   Major changes:
	   Rewrite almost entire code to implement these changes:
	   1. Now this addon is very light for those just want simple light functions. Swithed off those effects with big size (HDRI, Badges, Loot items)
	      If you want to have additional effects - download Assets ZIP file from here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/14z98OfTWH9Uku2MFssg1bs2qjjVVkOWz/view?usp=sharing
		  extract the files in your desired location
		  Inside addon in the "Readme First" Tab specify Assets folder location.
		  Thats it. Once you specify location of the Assets - all additional options will appear
	   2. Recolor now work with custom folders materials, can be with sub-folders or without it. Also added the option for Alpha channel
	   To differentiate which update affecting your current addon - it will be called now "Lite" and "Extended"
	   Extended Added:
	   Badge - Predator S3

                                                     USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:
                                            ####################################

1. Most of the tools in the Addon are designed and scaled to Apex models actual size. To size up the model to the correct scale you may do the following:
	a) Import Model
	b) Select bones
	c) Scale down to - 0.0254 (Shortcut for Scale is "S")
	Without correct scale some of the effects will look small/big, colors or textures might be offset too. 
2. Mods/effects/addons added inside are free to use/modify or were created by me/community for this Addon

        Auto_tex:
####################################
 
A little tool that will help you to texture Apex Models automatically. A small improvement being done to this addon. Previously if you select the objects and use the addon - it will Append "Apex Shader" and un-select all objects. Well, not anymore. :)

        Re-color:
####################################

Tool to re-color (re-texture) the model with the new or updated texture available in the game files. This is modified version of Auto_tex. Most of the code is same with small changes here and there.

Howto:
		a) Extract/Download new textures
		b) Specify the path to the texture folder (it must have a name like "wraith_lgnd_v19_liberator_rc01", not "_images" or other)
		c) Select options if the texture folder have sub-folders with names like "wraith_lgnd_v19_liberator_rc01_body" or all images inside (no sub-folders)
		d) Select option if you need Alpha channel to be plugged
		e) Select which shader you want to use
		f) Almost all Material do not have textures for eye, teeth, hair, you need to copy them out from the base model and place all that images into folder named "base"
		   the folder structure should be like this 
          -"Your_material_folder" -> base                                --> all base images here
                                  -> wraith_lgnd_v19_liberator_rc01_body --> body images here
                                  -> wraith_lgnd_v19_liberator_rc01_gear --> gear images here
