                                            ####################################

This tool were created to assist and simplify workflow for Apex Legends models in Blender since they cannot be simply exported from the game. Here i collect and organize useful tools/addons/operations all in one place. The addon itself is very light for those just want simple functions. 

If you want to have additional effects like auto set HDRI, Badges, Loot items - download Assets ZIP file from here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/14z98OfTWH9Uku2MFssg1bs2qjjVVkOWz/view?usp=sharing
extract the files in your desired location
Inside addon in the "Readme First" Tab specify Assets folder location.
Thats it. Once you specify location of the Assets - all additional options will appear

                                                     USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:
                                            ####################################

1. Most of the tools in the Addon are designed and scaled to Apex models actual size. To size up the model to the correct scale you may do the following:
	a) Import Model
	b) Select bones
	c) Scale down to - 0.0254 (Shortcut for Scale is "S")
	Without correct scale some of the effects will look small/big, colors or textures might be offset too. 
2. Mods/effects/addons added inside are free to use/modify or were created by me/community for this Addon

####################################

Tool to re-color (re-texture) the Legend or the Weapon with the new or updated texture available in the game files. This is modified version of Auto_tex. Nodes plugging procedure taken from there.

Howto:
		a) Extract/Download new textures
		b) Specify the path to the texture folder
		c) Select option if you need Alpha channel to be plugged
		d) Select which shader you want to use
		e) Almost all Material do not have textures for eye, teeth, hair, you need to copy them out from the base model and place all that images into folder named "base"
		   the folder structure should be like this 
          -"Your_material_folder" -> base                                --> all base images here
                                  -> wraith_lgnd_v19_liberator_rc01_body --> body images here
                                  -> wraith_lgnd_v19_liberator_rc01_gear --> gear images here
								  
		  If you have Assets folder installed - you may skip this step, base files included. 
		f) press Re-texture
		
		PS: It is also compartible with Titanfall 2 Models (Beta)

Attempt to make everyones life easier and also to reduce the insane amount of issues related to outdated addons or Legion+ software
For Legion+ settings - select the folder with Legion+ FOLDER, not Folder with LegionPlus.exe (Example: "MyFolder"/"Legion+1.4.1"/"LegionPlus.exe", so select "MyFolder")
Legion folder with LegionPlus.exe MUST remain same name as you extracted from zip (like Legion+1.4.1), dont change the name.
For Addons - this should go autopilot
