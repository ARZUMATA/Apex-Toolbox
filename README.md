# Apex-Toolbox

This tool was created to assist and simplify workflow for Apex Legends effects in Blender since they cannot be simply exported from the game. Here i collect and organize useful tools/addons/operations all in one place. 

### This addon have 2 modes "Lite" and "Extended" (both versions support MacOs now, v.3.0 and above). 
- Lite - small sized addon for those just want simple functions. 
- Extended - if you want to have additional effects like auto set HDRI, Badges, Loot items. You just need to download Assets ZIP file from here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/14z98OfTWH9Uku2MFssg1bs2qjjVVkOWz/view?usp=sharing and link extracted folder in the addon, additional features will be automatically activated.

All Credites and Instruction on effects usage can be found here: https://github.com/Gl2imm/Apex-Toolbox/blob/main/Apex_toolbox/Credits%20and%20Instructions.txt (It also comes with the plugin inside zip file)

The effects are done by me in my free time, some items are shared by useres in these 2 discords:
- Legion+ Discord: https://discord.gg/ADek6fxVGe (#3d-shenanigans)
- 3D Art Discord: https://discord.gg/VcZh5rC (#apex-legion)

If you have a good looking effect that you want to share and include in the addon - you may do so in one of the above discords.
