v2.0 Changes:
	   Major changes:
	   Rewrite almost entire code to implement these changes:
	   1. Now this addon is very light for those just want simple light functions. Swithed off those effects with big size (HDRI, Badges, Loot items)
	      If you want to have additional effects - download Assets ZIP file from here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/14z98OfTWH9Uku2MFssg1bs2qjjVVkOWz/view?usp=sharing
		  extract the files in your desired location
		  Inside addon in the "Readme First" Tab specify Assets folder location.
		  Thats it. Once you specify location of the Assets - all additional options will appear
	   2. Recolor now work with custom folders materials, can be with sub-folders or without it. Also added the option for Alpha channel
	   To differentiate which update affecting your current addon - it will be called now "Lite" and "Extended"
	   Extended Added:
	   Badge - Predator S3

v2.1 Changes:
	   Note: if you updating from v2.0 - pls re-download updated assets: https://drive.google.com/file/d/14z98OfTWH9Uku2MFssg1bs2qjjVVkOWz/view?usp=sharing
	   Or if you have limited data - download only updated files and manually replace in your asset folder: https://drive.google.com/file/d/17r_R_vVTcQ__XxR9TV9joz1GZW_ca3jU/view?usp=sharing
	   
	   Added to "Lite":

	   Added to "Extended":
	   HDRI: Kings Canyon (New), Kings Canyon (Night), Apex Lobby, Sky (Not sure its from which map)
	   Loot items: Basically all of them, heals, nades, backpacks, etc.
	   Effects: Added animated energy to the Shield batteries and cells.
	   Badges: S3 Predator
	   Base files: Added Legends base material files (eye, teeth, hair, etc) so it will auto link when you recolor the models. (Recolor materials not included base files)
	   
	   fixes:
	   Fixed Gibby bubble center icon not displayed.
	   Fixed mSlot reference before assigning error in Re-color and Autotex.
	   Changes:
	   Rewrite the code for recolor - now it supposed to work completely in autopilot mode, recoloring Legends and also weapons. Just select the folder with images or material folder and it will do the job. The code is straight from the oven, so slight chance errors might pop up. Pls feedback if there are any.. For our Titanfall fans - this will also recolor TTF Legends.
